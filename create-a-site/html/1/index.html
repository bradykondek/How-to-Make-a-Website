  <center><p>CloudCannon is a content management system, commonly known as CMS, that makes editing a website really easy.  It handles the colleciton, managing, and publishing aspects of a website.  Meaning you make the edits on the software, and it will publish it to the website you are editing.  CloudCannon is even cooler because it lets you have as many sites as you want on its platform and you can add domains, security certificates, and manage other cool settings.  It also makes navigating around and editing the source files of your site easy to understand.  None of this probably makes any sense to you right now, but you will understand this all more as you progress through the course.</p></center>
