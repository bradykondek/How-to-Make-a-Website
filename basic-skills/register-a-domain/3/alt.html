  <hr>
  <center><p>This is the part where you will actually be registering the domain.  You have already selected the one you want, now you will be registering it.  After clicking the green button, you will be taken to a page where you can select how long you want the domain for.  After that period ends, you can renew the domain.  The longest amount of time you can get a free domain for is 12 months, after that you simply renew it again for free.  Click where it says <b>3 Months @ Free</b>, and select from the list how long you want.  After you choose, click the blue button below that says <b>Continue</b>.</p><br><img src="/images/register-a-domain/7.jpg" width="700" height="300"><p>You will then be taken to the purchase screen.  If a table appears asking for information, fill it out.  It does not have to be real information, just put something.  Fill out all fields though.  You also have the option to lock the information, so if you go to register another domain in the future you won't have to fill out the information again, in fact the table won't even be there because it already knows what you would put in there.  You will need to check the box stating that you agree with their Terms & Conditions.  Once that is checked, click the blue button that says <b>Complete Order</b>.</p><br><img src="/images/register-a-domain/8.jpg" width="700" height="300"><p>A confirmation page will load, confirming that your order has been completed.  At this point, you have registered a domain!</p><br><img src="/images/register-a-domain/9.png" width="700" height="300">
